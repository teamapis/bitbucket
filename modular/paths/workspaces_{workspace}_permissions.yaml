    Returns the list of members in a workspace

    and their permission levels.

    Permission can be:

    * `owner`

    * `collaborator`

    * `member`


    **The `collaborator` role is being removed from the Bitbucket Cloud API. For
    more information,

    see the [deprecation
    announcement](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-collaborator-role/).**


    Example:


    ```

    $ curl -X https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/bbworkspace1/permissions
