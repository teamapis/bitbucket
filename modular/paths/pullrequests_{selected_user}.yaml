    Returns all pull requests authored by the specified user.


    By default only open pull requests are returned. This can be controlled

    using the `state` query parameter. To retrieve pull requests that are

    in one of multiple states, repeat the `state` parameter for each

    individual state.


    This endpoint also supports filtering and sorting of the results. See

    [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for more
    details.
