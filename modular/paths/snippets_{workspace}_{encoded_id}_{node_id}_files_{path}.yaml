    Retrieves the raw contents of a specific file in the snippet. The
    `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to avoid issues with
    malevolent executable files.

    The file's mime type is derived from its filename and returned in the
    `Content-Type` header.

    Note that for text files, no character encoding is included as part of
    the content type.
