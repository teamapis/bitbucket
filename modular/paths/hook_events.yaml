    Returns the webhook resource or subject types on which webhooks can
    be registered.

    Each resource/subject type contains an `events` link that returns the
    paginated list of specific events each individual subject type can
    emit.

    This endpoint is publicly accessible and does not require
    authentication or scopes.

    Example:

    ```
    $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/hook_events

    {
        "repository": {
            "links": {
                "events": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/hook_events/repository"
                }
            }
        },
        "workspace": {
            "links": {
                "events": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/hook_events/workspace"
                }
            }
        }
    }
