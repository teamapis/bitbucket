    Bulk upload of annotations.

    Annotations are individual findings that have been identified as part of a
    report, for example, a line of code that represents a vulnerability. These
    annotations can be attached to a specific file and even a specific line in
    that file, however, that is optional. Annotations are not mandatory and a
    report can contain up to 1000 annotations.


    Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON array and make
    sure each annotation has the external_id field set to a unique value. If you
    want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it
    with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example,
    mySystem-annotation001. The external id can later be used to identify the
    report as an alternative to the generated
    [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid).
    You can upload up to 100 annotations per POST request.


    ### Sample cURL request:

    ```

    curl --location
    'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<username>/<reposity-name>/commit/<commit-hash>/reports/mysystem-001/annotations'
    \

    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    --data-raw '[
      {
            "external_id": "mysystem-annotation001",
            "title": "Security scan report",
            "annotation_type": "VULNERABILITY",
            "summary": "This line represents a security threat.",
            "severity": "HIGH",
          "path": "my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Main.java",
            "line": 42
      },
      {
            "external_id": "mySystem-annotation002",
            "title": "Bug report",
            "annotation_type": "BUG",
            "result": "FAILED",
            "summary": "This line might introduce a bug.",
            "severity": "MEDIUM",
          "path": "my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Helper.java",
            "line": 13
      }
    ]'

    ```


    ### Possible field values:

    annotation_type: VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL, BUG

    result: PASSED, FAILED, IGNORED, SKIPPED

    severity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL
