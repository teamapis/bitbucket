    Creates or updates an individual annotation for the specified report.

    Annotations are individual findings that have been identified as part of a
    report, for example, a line of code that represents a vulnerability. These
    annotations can be attached to a specific file and even a specific line in
    that file, however, that is optional. Annotations are not mandatory and a
    report can contain up to 1000 annotations.


    Just as reports, annotation needs to be uploaded with a unique ID that can
    later be used to identify the report as an alternative to the generated
    [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid).
    If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend
    prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example,
    mySystem-annotation001.


    ### Sample cURL request:

    ```

    curl --request PUT
    'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<username>/<reposity-name>/commit/<commit-hash>/reports/mySystem-001/annotations/mysystem-annotation001'
    \

    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

    --data-raw '{
        "title": "Security scan report",
        "annotation_type": "VULNERABILITY",
        "summary": "This line represents a security thread.",
        "severity": "HIGH",
        "path": "my-service/src/main/java/com/myCompany/mysystem/logic/Main.java",
        "line": 42
    }'

    ```


    ### Possible field values:

    annotation_type: VULNERABILITY, CODE_SMELL, BUG

    result: PASSED, FAILED, IGNORED, SKIPPED

    severity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL
