    When merging a pull request takes too long, the client receives a

    task ID along with a 202 status code. The task ID can be used in a call

    to this endpoint to check the status of a merge task.


    ```

    curl -X GET
    https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bitbucket/pullrequests/2286/merge/task-status/<task_id>

    ```


    If the merge task is not yet finished, a PENDING status will be returned.


    ```

    HTTP/2 200

    {
        "task_status": "PENDING",
        "links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bitbucket/pullrequests/2286/merge/task-status/<task_id>"
            }
        }
    }

    ```


    If the merge was successful, a SUCCESS status will be returned.


    ```

    HTTP/2 200

    {
        "task_status": "SUCCESS",
        "links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bitbucket/pullrequests/2286/merge/task-status/<task_id>"
            }
        },
        "merge_result": <the merged pull request object>
    }

    ```


    If the merge task failed, an error will be returned.


    ```

    {
        "type": "error",
        "error": {
            "message": "<error message>"
        }
    }

    ```
