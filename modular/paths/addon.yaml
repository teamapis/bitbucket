    Deletes the application for the user.

    This endpoint is intended to be used by Bitbucket Connect apps
    and only supports JWT authentication -- that is how Bitbucket
    identifies the particular installation of the app. Developers
    with applications registered in the "Develop Apps" section
    of Bitbucket Marketplace need not use this endpoint as
    updates for those applications can be sent out via the
    UI of that section.

    ```
    $ curl -X DELETE https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
      -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>"

    Updates the application installation for the user.

    This endpoint is intended to be used by Bitbucket Connect apps
    and only supports JWT authentication -- that is how Bitbucket
    identifies the particular installation of the app. Developers
    with applications registered in the "Develop Apps" section
    of Bitbucket need not use this endpoint as updates for those
    applications can be sent out via the UI of that section.

    Passing an empty body will update the installation using the
    existing descriptor URL.

    ```
    $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
      -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{}'
    ```

    The new `descriptor` for the installation can be also provided
    in the body directly.

    ```
    $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
      -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"descriptor": $NEW_DESCRIPTOR}'
    ```

    In both these modes the URL of the descriptor cannot be changed. To
    change the descriptor location and upgrade an installation
    the request must be made exclusively with a `descriptor_url`.

     ```
    $ curl -X PUT https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/addon \
      -H "Authorization: JWT <JWT Token>" \
      --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data '{"descriptor_url": $NEW_URL}'
    ```

    The `descriptor_url` must exactly match the marketplace registration
    that Atlassian has for the application. Contact your Atlassian
    developer advocate to update this registration. Once the registration
    has been updated you may call this resource for each installation.

    Note that the scopes of the application cannot be increased
    in the new descriptor nor reduced to none.
