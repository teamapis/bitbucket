    Upload new download artifacts.

    To upload files, perform a `multipart/form-data` POST containing one
    or more `files` fields:

        $ echo Hello World > hello.txt
        $ curl -s -u evzijst -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/git-tests/downloads -F files=@hello.txt

    When a file is uploaded with the same name as an existing artifact,
    then the existing file will be replaced.
