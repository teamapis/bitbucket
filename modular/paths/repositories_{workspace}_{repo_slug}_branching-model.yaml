    - Branching model
  description: |-
    Return the branching model as applied to the repository. This view is
    read-only. The branching model settings can be changed using the
    [settings](branching-model/settings#get) API.

    The returned object:

    1. Always has a `development` property. `development.branch` contains
       the actual repository branch object that is considered to be the
       `development` branch. `development.branch` will not be present
       if it does not exist.
    2. Might have a `production` property. `production` will not
       be present when `production` is disabled.
       `production.branch` contains the actual branch object that is
       considered to be the `production` branch. `production.branch` will
       not be present if it does not exist.
    3. Always has a `branch_types` array which contains all enabled branch
       types.
