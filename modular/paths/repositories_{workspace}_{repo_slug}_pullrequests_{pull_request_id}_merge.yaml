        Default value is false.


        When set to true, runs merge asynchronously and
        immediately returns a 202 with polling link to
        the task-status API in the Location header.


        When set to false, runs merge and waits for it to
        complete, returning 200 when it succeeds. If the
        duration of the merge exceeds a timeout threshold,
        the API returns a 202 with polling link to the
        task-status API in the Location header.
