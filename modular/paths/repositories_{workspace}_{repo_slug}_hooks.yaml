  description: |-
    Creates a new webhook on the specified repository.

    Example:

    ```
    $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
      https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo-slug/hooks
      -d '
        {
          "description": "Webhook Description",
          "url": "https://example.com/",
          "active": true,
          "events": [
            "repo:push",
            "issue:created",
            "issue:updated"
          ]
        }'
    ```

    Note that this call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope
    that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In the
    example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.

    Also note that the `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an
    internal, non-routed address.
