    - Commits
  description: >-
    These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned

    in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of `git log`.

    Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.


    #### GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/master


    Returns all commits on rev `master` (similar to `git log master`).


    #### GET
    /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?include=foo&exclude=master


    Returns all commits on ref `dev` or `foo`, except those that are reachable
    on

    `master` (similar to `git log dev foo ^master`).


    An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the

    results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file

    or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that

    have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is

    important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits

    returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that

    do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.


    #### GET
    /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master


    Returns all commits that are on refs `dev` or `foo` or `bar`, but not on
    `master`

    that changed the file README.md.


    #### GET
    /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/dev?path=src/&include=foo&exclude=master


    Returns all commits that are on refs `dev` or `foo`, but not on `master`

    that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.


    Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it

    is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the

    next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not

    construct your own links.


    When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a

    query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

    Identical to `GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/{revision}`,
    except that POST allows clients to place the include and exclude
    parameters in the request body to avoid URL length issues.

    **Note that this resource does NOT support new commit creation.**
