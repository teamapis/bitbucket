    Returns all pull requests on the specified repository.


    By default only open pull requests are returned. This can be controlled

    using the `state` query parameter. To retrieve pull requests that are

    in one of multiple states, repeat the `state` parameter for each

    individual state.


    This endpoint also supports filtering and sorting of the results. See

    [filtering and sorting](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) for more
    details.

    Creates a new pull request where the destination repository is

    this repository and the author is the authenticated user.


    The minimum required fields to create a pull request are `title` and

    `source`, specified by a branch name.


    ```

    curl
    https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repository/pullrequests
    \
        -u my-username:my-password \
        --request POST \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "staging"
                }
            }
        }'
    ```


    If the pull request's `destination` is not specified, it will default

    to the `repository.mainbranch`. To open a pull request to a

    different branch, say from a feature branch to a staging branch,

    specify a `destination` (same format as the `source`):


    ```

    {
        "title": "My Title",
        "source": {
            "branch": {
                "name": "my-feature-branch"
            }
        },
        "destination": {
            "branch": {
                "name": "staging"
            }
        }
    }

    ```


    Reviewers can be specified by adding an array of user objects as the

    `reviewers` property.


    ```

    {
        "title": "My Title",
        "source": {
            "branch": {
                "name": "my-feature-branch"
            }
        },
        "reviewers": [
            {
                "uuid": "{504c3b62-8120-4f0c-a7bc-87800b9d6f70}"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```


    Other fields:


    * `description` - a string

    * `close_source_branch` - boolean that specifies if the source branch should
    be closed upon merging

      The request URL you POST to becomes the destination repository URL. For
      this reason, you must specify an explicit source repository in the request
      object if you want to pull from a different repository (fork).


      Since not all elements are required or even mutable, you only need to
      include the elements you want to initialize, such as the source branch and
      the title.
