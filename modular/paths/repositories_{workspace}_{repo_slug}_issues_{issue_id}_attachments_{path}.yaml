    Returns the contents of the specified file attachment.

    Note that this endpoint does not return a JSON response, but instead
    returns a redirect pointing to the actual file that in turn will return
    the raw contents.

    The redirect URL contains a one-time token that has a limited lifetime.
    As a result, the link should not be persisted, stored, or shared.
