    This endpoint is used to poll for the progress of an issue export

    job and return the zip file after the job is complete.

    As long as the job is running, this will return a 200 response

    with in the response body a description of the current status.


    After the job has been scheduled, but before it starts executing, this

    endpoint's response is:


    {
     "type": "issue_job_status",
     "status": "ACCEPTED",
     "phase": "Initializing",
     "total": 0,
     "count": 0,
     "pct": 0
    }



    Then once it starts running, it becomes:


    {
     "type": "issue_job_status",
     "status": "STARTED",
     "phase": "Attachments",
     "total": 15,
     "count": 11,
     "pct": 73
    }


    Once the job has successfully completed, it returns a stream of the zip
    file.
