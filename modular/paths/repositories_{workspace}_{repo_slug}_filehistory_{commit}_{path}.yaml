    Returns a paginated list of commits that modified the specified file.


    Commits are returned in reverse chronological order. This is roughly

    equivalent to the following commands:

        $ git log --follow --date-order <sha> <path>

    By default, Bitbucket will follow renames and the path name in the

    returned entries reflects that. This can be turned off using the

    `?renames=false` query parameter.


    Results are returned in descending chronological order by default, and

    like most endpoints you can

    [filter and sort](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) the response to

    only provide exactly the data you want.


    For example, if you wanted to find commits made before 2011-05-18

    against a file named `README.rst`, but you only wanted the path and

    date, your query would look like this:


    ```

    $ curl
    'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/filehistory/master/README.rst'\
      '?fields=values.next,values.path,values.commit.date&q=commit.date<=2011-05-18'
    {
      "values": [
        {
          "commit": {
            "date": "2011-05-17T07:32:09+00:00"
          },
          "path": "README.rst"
        },
        {
          "commit": {
            "date": "2011-05-16T06:33:28+00:00"
          },
          "path": "README.txt"
        },
        {
          "commit": {
            "date": "2011-05-16T06:15:39+00:00"
          },
          "path": "README.txt"
        }
      ]
    }

    ```


    In the response you can see that the file was renamed to `README.rst`

    by the commit made on 2011-05-16, and was previously named `README.txt`.
