    - Workspaces
  description: >-
    Returns an object for each workspace the caller is a member of, and

    their effective role - the highest level of privilege the caller has.

    If a user is a member of multiple groups with distinct roles, only the

    highest level is returned.


    Permissions can be:


    * `owner`

    * `collaborator`

    * `member`


    **The `collaborator` role is being removed from the Bitbucket Cloud API. For
    more information,

    see the [deprecation
    announcement](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-collaborator-role/).**


    Example:


    ```

    $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/user/permissions/workspaces


    {
      "pagelen": 10,
      "page": 1,
      "size": 1,
      "values": [
        {
          "type": "workspace_membership",

          "last_accessed": "2019-03-07T12:35:02.900024+00:00",
          "added_on": "2018-10-11T17:42:02.961424+00:00",
          "user": {
            "type": "user",
            "uuid": "{470c176d-3574-44ea-bb41-89e8638bcca4}",
            "nickname": "evzijst",
            "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          },
          "workspace": {
            "type": "workspace",
            "uuid": "{a15fb181-db1f-48f7-b41f-e1eff06929d6}",
            "slug": "bbworkspace1",
            "name": "Atlassian Bitbucket",
          }
        }
      ]
    }

    ```


    Results may be further [filtered or
    sorted](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#filtering) by

    workspace or permission by adding the following query string parameters:


    * `q=workspace.slug="bbworkspace1"` or `q=permission="owner"`

    * `sort=workspace.slug`


    Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`

    would become `%3D`.
