    Produces a response in JSON format with a record for every path

    modified, including information on the type of the change and the

    number of lines added and removed.


    #### Single commit spec


    If the `spec` argument to this API is a single commit, the diff is

    produced against the first parent of the specified commit.


    #### Two commit spec


    Two commits separated by `..` may be provided as the `spec`, e.g.,

    `3a8b42..9ff173`. When two commits are provided and the `topic` query

    parameter is true or absent, this API produces a 2-way three dot diff.

    This is the diff between source commit and the merge base of the source

    commit and the destination commit. When the `topic` query param is false,

    a simple git-style diff is produced.


    The two commits are interpreted as follows:


    * First commit: the commit containing the changes we wish to preview

    * Second commit: the commit representing the state to which we want to
      compare the first commit
    * **Note**: This is the opposite of the order used in `git diff`.

      This parameter is deprecated and will be removed at the end
      of 2022. The 'topic' parameter should be used instead. The
      'merge' and 'topic' parameters cannot be both used at the same
      time.

      If true, the source commit is merged into the
      destination commit, and then a diffstat from the
      destination to the merge result is returned. If false,
      a simple 'two dot' diffstat between the source and
      destination is returned. True if omitted.
