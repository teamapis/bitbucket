      key:
        type: string
        description: |-
          An identifier for the status that's unique to
                  its type (current "build" is the only supported type) and the vendor,
                  e.g. BB-DEPLOY
      refname:
        type: string
        description: |-

          The name of the ref that pointed to this commit at the time the status
          object was created. Note that this the ref may since have moved off of
          the commit. This optional field can be useful for build systems whose
          build triggers and configuration are branch-dependent (e.g. a Pipeline
          build).
          It is legitimate for this field to not be set, or even apply (e.g. a
          static linting job).
      url:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A URL linking back to the vendor or build system, for providing more
          information about whatever process produced this status. Accepts
          context variables `repository` and `commit` that Bitbucket will
          evaluate at runtime whenever at runtime. For example, one could use
          https://foo.com/builds/{repository.full_name} which Bitbucket will
          turn into https://foo.com/builds/foo/bar at render time.
