description: A paged list of variables.
properties:
  page:
    type: integer
    description: >-
      Page number of the current results. This is an optional element that is
      not provided in all responses.
  values:
    type: array
    minItems: 0
    items:
      $ref: ./pipeline_variable.yaml
    description: The values of the current page.
  size:
    type: integer
    description: >-
      Total number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that
      is not provided in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute.
  pagelen:
    type: integer
    description: >-
      Current number of objects on the existing page. The default value is 10
      with 100 being the maximum allowed value. Individual APIs may enforce
      different values.
  next:
    type: string
    format: uri
    description: >-
      Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a collection does not
      have this value. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from
      constructing your own URLs.
  previous:
    type: string
    format: uri
    description: >-
      Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first page does not have
      this value. This is an optional element that is not provided in all
      responses. Some result sets strictly support forward navigation and never
      provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards navigation
      is not always available. Use this link to navigate the result set and
      refrain from constructing your own URLs.
